Date: 3/01/2023

This program is designed to demonstrate how to use threads in C#. This example uses the monte carlo method to estimate the value of pi. 

## How to Run
* Press the play button in Visual Studio to run the program.
* Once the console opens, the user will be asked to input the amount of times a dart must be thrown for each thread.
* The user will then be asked to type in the number of threads.
* The result of the pi estimation will then be displayed.
* Press any key to exit.

## Design Decisions
* The code has been separated between different files to keep the code easy to read.
